# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## CI / CD — GitHub Actions (automatic build & deploy)

This repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow that builds the app and deploys the production output to the `gh-pages` branch when you push to `main`.

Key points:

- Workflow file: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- It runs `npm install` (or `npm ci` if a lockfile exists) and `npm run build`, then publishes the produced `build/` directory to the `gh-pages` branch using the Actions token.

What you may want to check or customize:

- GitHub Pages: after the first deployment, go to your repository Settings → Pages and set the source to the `gh-pages` branch (or choose the repository Pages option that works for you).
- Custom domain: if you use a custom domain, place a `CNAME` file under `public/` or on the `gh-pages` branch.
- Node version: the workflow uses Node.js 18; change it in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` if you need a different version.

Secrets:

- No extra secrets are required; the workflow uses the automatically-provided `GITHUB_TOKEN` to push the build to `gh-pages`.

Triggering deployments:

- Any push to `main` will trigger the workflow and (if the build succeeds) publish to `gh-pages`.

If you'd like a different target (Netlify / Vercel / Surge), I can update the workflow to publish to those services instead — tell me which one you prefer.
